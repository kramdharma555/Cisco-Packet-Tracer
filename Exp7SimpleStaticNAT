Aim: Configure NAT on Cisco Packet Tracer.

Apparatus: PCâ€™s, Switches, Routers, Cables etc.

Procedure:

Network Address Translation (NAT)
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa.

 
 
Configuring Static NAT






Configuring Dynamic NAT









Understand the Following 
Step 1: Prepare the network in the following manner













Step 2: Type the Following Commands
Open the router Router 0 CLI Mode:
Enable
Config t (Configure Terminal)
Interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
Ip add 192.168.10.1  255.255.255.0
No shutdown
End
Step 3: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode 
Config t (Configure Terminal)
Interface GigabitEthernet 0/0 
Ip add 10.0.0.1  255.255.255.252
No shutdown
End
Step 4: Type the Following Commands
Then Open router Router 1 CLI Mode
Enable 
Config t (Configure Terminal)
Interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
Ip add 10.0.0.2  255.255.255.252
No shutdown
End
Step 5: Type the Following Commands
Ping PC0 
Ping 192.168.10.1
Successful
Ping 10.0.0.1
Successful
Ping 192.168.10.20
Successful
Ping 10.0.0.2
Not successful
Step 6: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode
Enable 
Ping 192.168.10.10
Ping 192.168.10.20
Ping 10.0.0.2
Step 7: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode
Enable 
Config t (Configure Terminal)
Interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
Ip nat inside
Exit
Interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
Ip nat outside
Exit
Ip nat inside source ?
Ip nat inside source  static ?
Ip nat inside source  static 192.168.10.10 ?
Ip nat inside source  static 192.168.10.10  10.0.0.1 ?
Ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.10  10.0.0.1
Step 8: Type the Following Commands
              Open PC0 CMD
Again ping 10.0.0.2
Successful

Step 9: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode
Enable
Show ip nat translations
Debug ip nat 
->//PC0 ping 10.0.0.2 [see this clearly]

Step 10: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode
Enable
Config t (Configure Terminal)
Ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.20  10.0.0.100
->//if pc1 not ping to 10.0.0.2 then 
No Ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.10  10.0.0.100
Ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.10  10.0.0.1
No debug ip nat
Step 11: Type the Following Commands
Open router Router 0 CLI mode
Enable
Show ip nat translations
 


Result/Output:
The Configuration of Network Address Translation in NAT is successfully done and checked out the results.
