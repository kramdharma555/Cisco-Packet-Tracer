Aim: Design a network for Hybrid Topology and Checking the connectivity between Two Networks

Requirements: Basic Concepts of Bus/Star/Hybrid Topology, Download and Install Cisco Packet Tracer, IP Addressing

Configuration Steps
Step 1: Choose the Number of required PC’s and Switch 2950-24
Step 2: Keep and Assign the given IP address for each and every device (Listed Below)
IP Address of the Chosen PC’s

Step 3: Configure the Topology Design (Hybrid Type – Refer figure)
Step 4: Sake/Connect the PCs using 'Copper Straight Through Cable’
Step 5: Set Ethernet Connection
Step 6: Configure the PCs (hosts) with IPv4 address and Subnet Mask according to the IP addressing table given
Note:
•	To assign an IP address in PC0, click on PC0.
•	Then, go to desktop and IP configuration and there you will find IPv4 configuration.
•	Add IPv4 address and subnet mask.

Assigning IP address using the ipconfig command.
•	We can also assign an IP address with the help of a command.
•	Go to the command terminal of the PC.
•	Now type ipconfig <IPv4 address><subnet mask><default gateway>(if needed)
•	example: ipconfig 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 

Network Design

Step 7: Verify the connection by pinging the IP address of any host in PC0.

•	Use the ping command to verify the connection.
•	We will check, if we are getting any replies or not.
•	As we can see here getting replies from a targeted node on both PCs. Hence the connection is verified.

Step 8: Take Email Application and run the simulation 

Note: A simulation of the experiment is given below we have sent two PDU packets one targeted from PC0 to PC4 and another targeted from PC3 to PC8.

Output/Result
Hence, it is observed packet transfer is done between the networks of hybrid (bus/star) topology.
