Aim: Design a hybrid topology with a bus backbone and two-star networks and check the connectivity between two systems.

Apparatus: PC’s, Switches, Routers, Cables etc.

Procedure:
Step 1: Configure the network like the following by taking certain number of required PCs, Switches, Hubs etc.


 

Step 2: Assign the IP Address for each PC and Connect them using the required cables 
•	IP for PC1: 192.168.0.1 and Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (Example for PC1)

Step 3: Ensure Hybrid (Bus/Two Star Topologies) existed
Step 4: Add the Application for the sample and observe the execution

Result/Output:
The Configuration of Hybrid Topology (Two Networks of Star Topology and Bus Topology) is made and the results are observed.
