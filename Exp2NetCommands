Aim: Study of basic network command and Network configuration commands.
 
•	Ping Command
The ping command is one of the most often used networking utilities for detecting devices on a network and for troubleshooting network problems.
C:\>ping www.google.com or ping 216.58.20 
 
•	ipconfig Command 
Finding Your IP Address and Default Gateway
 
Ip config has a number of switches the most common are:
ipconfig /all – displays more information about the network setup on your systems including the MAC address.
 
ipconfig /release – release the current IP address
ipconfig /renew – renew IP address
 
ipconfig /? -shows help
ipconfig/flushdns – flush the dns cache
 
•	Hostname Command
A very simple command that displays the host name of your machine. This is much quicker than going to the control panel>system route.
 

•	getmac
Another very simple command that shows the MAC address of your network interfaces


•	arp Command
This is used for showing the address resolution cache. This command must be used with a command line switch arp -a is the most common.
To send IP packets, a computer needs two addresses. These addresses are the MAC address and the IP address. A MAC address is the physical or hardware address of the NIC. An IP address is the logical or software address of NIC. If a computer knows the IP address of the destination computer but it does not know the MAC address of the destination computer, it uses the ARP protocol to know the MAC address of the destination computer.
The ARP protocol broadcasts a given IP address over a local network. The corresponding host responds to the broadcast with its MAC address. To avoid repetition, ARP stores the answer in a table known as ARP table. ARP maintains a separate ARP table for each NIC.
 
Type arp at the command line to see all available options.
•	traceroute 
The tracert command prints the path. If all routers on the path are functional, this command prints the full path. If a router is down on the path, this command prints the path up to the last operational router.

•	Nslookup
o	The main use of nslookup is for troubleshooting DNS related problems.
o	Nslookup can be use in interactive and non-interactive mode.
o	To use in interactive mode type nslookup at the command line and hit return
 
Uses
•	Find the IP address of a host.
•	Find the domain name of an IP address.
•	Find mail servers for a domain.
 

•	netstat -f
Active TCP connections history listed
 
•	systeminfo 
It can access the system’s hardware and software details, such as processor data, booting data, Windows version, etc
 
•	route
The route tool displays the routing table that allows Windows 10 to understand the network and communicate with other devices and services.
 
•	netsh
On Windows 10, netsh (Network Shell) is a legacy command-line tool that allows you to display and change virtually any network configuration. For instance, you can use the tool to view the current network configurations, manage wireless connections, reset the network stack to fix most common problems, enable or disable the firewall, and a lot more
